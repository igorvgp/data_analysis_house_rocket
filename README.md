# House Rocket
> Increasing a real estate company's profit through data analysis.


## **1. Abstract**
House Rocket is a real estate buying and selling company primarily operating in King County, Washington State, USA. It is a fictitious company and used here to illustrate the **insights generation process** through analyzing and manipulating data to assist in **business decision making**.


House Rocket's strategic area wants to find the best opportunities for buying and selling real estate to maximize the company's profits. The business team cannot make good decisions without analyzing the data and the portfolio is very large and it would take a long time to perform this analysis manually.

The solution was presented through a Dashboard containing the information requested by the business team. It can be accessed by clicking [here](https://igorvgp-data-analysis-hou-appv03-streamlit-app-dashboard-w7yl50.streamlit.app/).

A data analysis answering the main business questions was also developed. The notebook can be accessed by clicking [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/igorvgp/data_analysis_house_rocket/blob/main/notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb).

### **2.2. Business assumption**
 
* There may be typing errors in some records that must be dealt with/removed during data cleaning.

* The `date` variable refers to the date the property was made available for sale.

* Properties where the `yr_renovated` variable is equal to 0, are considered to have not undergone renovations.


## **3. Solution Plan**

To solve business problems, we explore the data, create hypotheses, validate them and learn from them, we use them in building the solution, which were delivered according to the need.

### **3.1. Tools & Techniques**

To solve the problems presented, the following was used:

* Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn and Geopandas.
* Jupyter Notebook and VSCode.
* Streamlit e Streamlit Cloud.
* Git and Github.
* Descriptive statistics techniques.
* Exploratory Data Analysis techniques (EDA). 

### **3.2. Deliverables**

For this problem, the following solutions were delivered:

* [Map with all properties and its details](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/igorvgp/data_analysis_house_rocket/blob/main/results/kc_house_map.html).

* [Online Dashboard](https://igorvgp-data-analysis-hou-appv03-streamlit-app-dashboard-w7yl50.streamlit.app/).


## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**


### **4.1. Main Insights**

The main insights found were:


**1. Properties with waterview are more expensive.**
On the map, you can see that most of the properties owith waterview are labeled with black dots, it means that they are more expensive.

With a dashboard containing the main business metrics and a map containing detailed information for each property, steakholders will be able to perform online analysis, increasing agility and accuracy in decision-making.

## **6. Next Steps**

As next steps, we suggest:
